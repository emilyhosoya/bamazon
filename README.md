DU Coding Bootcamp Assignment #12: Node.js &amp; MySQL

## Overview

This is an Amazon-like storefront using Node.js and MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. On the admin side (for managers and supervisors), the app tracks product sales across the store's departments and then provides a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
